This use case is unique to Python and is not found in statically compiled languages or languages that only support single inheritance. This makes it possible to implement “diamond diagrams” where multiple base classes implement the same method. Good design dictates that such implementations have the same calling signature in every case (because the order of calls is determined at runtime, because that order adapts to changes in the class hierarchy, and because that order can include sibling classes that are unknown prior to runtime).\n",

    "Note that super() is implemented as part of the binding process for explicit dotted attribute lookups such as super().__getitem__(name).

Accordingly, super() is undefined for implicit lookups using statements or operators such as super()[name].\n",
